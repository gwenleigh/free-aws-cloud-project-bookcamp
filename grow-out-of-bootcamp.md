# Grow out of Bootcamp

You could outgrow our bootcamp and go beyond the boundaries by trying implementing the following ideas, which involve much more intense use of AWS cloud services and other technologies for app development.&#x20;

### Task List

* [ ] :maple\_leaf: **1.1.0 Lambdarise**: we could put every single `.py` files in the `backend-flask/services` into lambda functions so every function runs on AWS Lambda.&#x20;
* [ ] **2.0.0 More custom traces**: try creating more custom trace data and send it through the spans.



### Research further

**Week 2 Live stream**

* [ ] Observability
* [ ] Synthetic testing
  * [ ] DataDog
