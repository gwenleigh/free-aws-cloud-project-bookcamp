# Hello, World!

Welcome to my learning journal / documentation (or companion resource in [Andrew](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-wc-brown/)'s word) for Andrews' Free AWS Cloud Project Bootcamp. I was the cohort 1 of this bootcamp which started at the end of February and ran til May-June 2023.&#x20;

## The Story

Back when I was starting, I didn't know how to work on a software development project in a smart way and how to share my knowledge with the community. I was so confused and lost and ended up dropping it in the middle of the race. Andrew was generous enough to give those still behind some time to catch up even after the end of the Camp, but I didn't make it. June passed, July came and went, then August, then September... Then [Andrews](https://exampro.co/)' [Terraform Project Bootcamp](https://terraform.cloudprojectbootcamp.com/) happened. So I jumped in and left all this behind.&#x20;

The Terraform Camp was short and easy enough to follow. I was able to stick through it and brought [this short book about Terraform (in Golang)](https://gwen-leigh.gitbook.io/multiverse-of-madness-terraform-with-go/) to life. This experience taught me how to organise my learning in the way that can benefit not just me, but other fellow campers. So I'm coming back to where I left off to pick it up again. In fact, I'm starting from scratch, because it's been a long time I need a refresh.&#x20;

If there is anyone else who is in the same journey, I hope this short book about AWS Cloud can help you along and offer you some insights.

## Content structure

* Each page documents the **workflow** of each development unit.
* Then follows a discussion on various technologies that Andrew mentions or used in the video, but not covered in depth; or anything that's featured and worth having a closer look.

### :bookmark\_tabs: **Notes**&#x20;

* Andrew's videos contain the "raw process" of software development in real life - meaning the videos often contain the trials and errors and the bruises and burns. So expect that there are a fair bit of progress and setbacks, troubleshooting, writing lines of code and then removing them or editing them all over again. My book does not document the whole process in a timely sequence. It documents only the resulting bits that are implemented in the final code.&#x20;

### :maple\_leaf: The maple leaves

The whole project design and the resulting source code is the sole creation of the [Andrews](https://www.exampro.co/), not mine. I try to explain things in my own words in this book, but I also would love to highlight and credit the [Andrews](https://www.exampro.co/)' insights and their teachings. So bits that have the maple leaves are direct quotes from the [Andrews](https://www.exampro.co/) from the videos.
